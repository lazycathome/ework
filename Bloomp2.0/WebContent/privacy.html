<tr><td><p align="left"><strong>1. Your Acceptance</strong><br />
    This is an  agreement between Bloomp Inc., a California corporation (&ldquo;Bloomp&quot;), the  owner and operator of www.bloompnote.com (the &ldquo;Bloomp Site&rdquo;), the Bloomp mobile  application, software, design, servers, data, user input, content and  associated services  (collectively the  &quot;Bloomp Service&quot;, or the &quot;Service&quot;), and you (&ldquo;you&rdquo; or  &ldquo;You&rdquo;), a user of the Service. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE  TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND BLOOMP&rsquo;S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT  http://www.bloompnote.com, AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If  you choose to not agree with any of these terms, you may not use the Service.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>2. Bloomp Service</strong><br />
      These Terms of  Service apply to all users of the Bloomp Service. Information provided by our  users through the Bloomp Service may contain links to third party websites that  are not owned or controlled by Bloomp. Bloomp has no control over, and assumes  no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third  party. In addition, Bloomp will not and cannot censor or edit the content of  any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree  that Bloomp shall not be responsible for any damages, claims or other liability  arising from or related to your use of any third-party website.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>3. Bloomp Access</strong><br />
      A. Subject to your  compliance with these Terms of Service, Bloomp hereby grants you permission to  use the Service, provided that: (i) your use of the Service as permitted is  solely for your personal use, and you are not permitted to resell or charge  others for use of or access to the Service, or in any other manner inconsistent  with these Terms of Service; (ii) you will not duplicate, transfer, give access  to, copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without Bloomp's  prior written authorization; (iii) you will not attempt to reverse engineer,  alter or modify any part of the Service; and (iv) you will otherwise comply  with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.<br />
      B. In order to  access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you  will have to provide Bloomp with your mobile phone number. You expressly  acknowledge and agree that in order to provide the Service, Bloomp may  periodically access your contact list and/or address book on your mobile device  to find and keep track of mobile phone numbers of other users of the Service.  When providing your mobile phone number, you must provide accurate and complete  information. You hereby give your express consent to Bloomp to access your  contact list and/or address book for mobile phone numbers in order to provide  and use the Service. You are solely responsible for the status messages that  you submit and that are displayed for your mobile phone number on the Bloomp  Service. You must notify Bloomp immediately of any breach of security or  unauthorized use of your mobile phone. Although Bloomp will not be liable for  your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable  for the losses of Bloomp or others due to such unauthorized use.<br />
      C. You agree not to  use or launch any automated system, including without limitation,  &quot;robots,&quot; &quot;spiders,&quot; &quot;offline readers,&quot; etc. or  &quot;load testers&quot; such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload,  blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc., that accesses the Service in a manner  that sends more request messages to the Bloomp servers in a given period of  time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a Bloomp  application, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically  allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bloomp grants the operators of public  search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the website for  the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the  materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Bloomp reserves the  right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While  we don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in  general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our  protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Bloomp  clients. We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler  or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to  explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission  before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network  equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or  harvest any personally identifiable information, including phone number, from  the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for  any commercial solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit  for commercial purposes, any users of the Service.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>4. Intellectual  Property Rights</strong><br />
      The design of the Bloomp  Service along with Bloomp created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features  and the like, except Status Submissions (as defined below), and the trademarks,  service marks and logos contained therein (&quot;Marks&quot;), are owned by or  licensed to Bloomp, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights  under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The Service  is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. Bloomp  reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service. You agree to  not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Service other  than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of  Status Submissions of third parties obtained through the Service for any  commercial purposes.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>5. User Status  Submissions</strong><br />
      A. The Bloomp  Service allows Bloomp users to submit status text, profile photos and other  communications submitted by you (collectively, the &quot;Status  Submissions&quot;). These Status Submissions may be hosted, shared, and/or  published as part of the Bloomp Service, and may be visible to other users of  the Service who have your mobile phone number in their mobile phone and which  you have not expressly blocked. For clarity, direct messages, location data and  photos or files that you send directly to other Bloomp users will only be  viewable by those Bloomp user(s) or group(s) you directly send such  information; but Status Submissions may be globally viewed by Bloomp users that  have your mobile phone number on their smartphone, unless the user is blocked  by you. Currently, we have no method of providing different levels of  visibility of your Status Submissions among users that have your mobile phone  number – you acknowledge and agree that any Status Submissions may be globally  viewed by users that have your mobile phone number, so don&rsquo;t submit or post status  messages or profile photos that you don&rsquo;t want to be seen globally. A good rule  of thumb is if you don&rsquo;t want the whole world to know something or see  something, don&rsquo;t submit it as a Status Submission to the Service. The  submission of your 'last seen' status is done on an automatic basis. As  clarified in the following section, you retain your ownership rights in your  Status Submissions. You understand that whether or not such Status Submissions  are published, Bloomp does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to  any submissions.<br />
      B. You shall be  solely responsible for your own Status Submissions and the consequences of  posting or publishing them. Because Bloomp is only acting as a repository of  data, user submitted statuses do not necessarily represent the views or  opinions of Bloomp, and Bloomp makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy  or legal status of any status. In connection with Status Submissions, you  affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary  licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Bloomp to use  all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in  and to any and all Status Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the Status  Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of  Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of  each and every identifiable individual person in the Status Submission to use  the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to  enable inclusion and use of the Status Submissions in the manner contemplated  by the Service and these Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your  ownership rights in your Status Submissions, but you have to have the rights in  the first place. However, by submitting the Status Submissions to Bloomp, you  hereby grant Bloomp a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable  and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative  works of, display, and perform the Status Submissions in connection with the Bloomp  Service and Bloomp's (and its successor's) business, including without  limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Bloomp Service  (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media  channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on the Bloomp  Service a non-exclusive license to access your Status Submissions through the  Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or  delete a Status Submission from the Bloomp Service.<br />
      C. In connection  with Status Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit  material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to  third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless  you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner  to post the material and to grant Bloomp all of the license rights granted  herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Bloomp  or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene,  defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically  offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense,  give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate;  (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another  person; (vi) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan  horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs;  (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or  the data contained therein; or (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to  the Service or its related systems or networks.<br />
      D. Adult content  must be identified as such. Bloomp does not endorse any Status Submission or  any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Bloomp expressly  disclaims any and all liability in connection with Status Submissions. Bloomp  does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of  intellectual property rights via its Service, and Bloomp will remove all  content and Status Submissions if properly notified that such content or Status  Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. To file a  copyright infringement notification, please send a written communication that  includes substantially the following (see Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital  Millennium Copyright Act): (i) A physical or electronic signature of a person  authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is  allegedly infringed; (ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to  have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site  are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;  (iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be  the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which  is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service  provider to locate the material, including the mobile phone number of the Bloomp  user allegedly infringing the copyrighted work; (iv) Information reasonably  sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party,  such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail  address at which the complaining party may be contacted; (v) A statement that  the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the  manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or  the law; and (vi) A statement that the information in the notification is  accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is  authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is  allegedly infringed. Such takedown notices may be emailed to support at Bloompnote.com.  Bloomp reserves the right to remove content and Status Submissions without  prior notice. Bloomp may also terminate a user's access to the Service, if they  are determined to be a repeat infringer, or for any or no reason, including  being annoying. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of  infringing activity more than once and/or has had a Status Submission removed  from the Service more than twice. An annoying person is anyone who is  (capriciously or not) determined to be annoying by authorized Bloomp employees,  agents, subagents, superagents or superheros. Bloomp also reserves the right to  decide whether content or a Status Submission is appropriate and complies with  these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and  violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to excessive  length or limited interest. Bloomp may remove such Status Submissions and/or  terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these  Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.<br />
      E. You understand  that when using the Bloomp Service you will be exposed to Status Submissions  from a variety of sources, and that Bloomp is not responsible for the accuracy,  usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such  Status Submissions, and that such Status Submissions are not the responsibility  of Bloomp. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to  Status Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable,  and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or  remedies you have or may have against Bloomp with respect thereto, and agree to  indemnify and hold Bloomp, its officers, directors, employees, agents,  affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law  regarding all matters related to your use of the Bloomp Service.<br />
      F. Bloomp permits  you to link to materials on the Service for personal purposes only. Bloomp  reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Bloomp Service at any time.</p>

AS WITH THE PURCHASE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE THROUGH ANY MEDIUM OR IN  ANY ENVIRONMENT, YOU SHOULD USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND EXERCISE CAUTION WHERE  APPROPRIATE.

      The Service is  controlled and offered by Bloomp from its facilities in the United States of  America. Bloomp makes no representations that the Bloomp Service is appropriate  or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Bloomp  Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are  responsible for compliance with local law.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>8. Indemnity</strong><br />
      You agree to  defend, indemnify and hold harmless Bloomp, its parent corporation, officers,  directors, employees and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages,  obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but  not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the  Bloomp Service; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service;  (iii) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any  copyright, property, or privacy right; or (iv) any claim that one of your  Status Submissions caused damage to a third party. This defense and  indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of  the Bloomp Service. We don't support or encourage illegal consumption of  alcohol or tobacco, so there.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>9. Ability to  Accept Terms of Service</strong><br />
      You affirm that you  are either more than 16 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal  parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into  the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and  warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with  these Terms of Service. In any case, you affirm that you are at least 16 years  old as the Bloomp Service is not intended for children under 16. If you are  under 16 years of age, you are not permitted to use the Bloomp Service. You  further represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is  subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.  Government as a&rdquo; terrorist-supporting&rdquo; country, and that you are not listed on  any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. </p>
    <p align="left"><strong>10. Assignment</strong><br />
      These Terms of  Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred  or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Bloomp without restriction.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>11. General</strong><br />
      You agree that: (i)  the Bloomp Service shall be deemed solely based in California; (ii) the Bloomp  Service shall be deemed a passive server that does not give rise to personal  jurisdiction over Bloomp, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other  than California; and (iii) that you agree to subject to the jurisdiction of  California in the event of any legal dispute. These Terms of Service shall be  governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without  respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you  and Bloomp that arises in whole or in part from the Bloomp Service shall be  decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Santa Clara  County, California. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy at  http://www.Bloompnote.com and any other legal notices published by Bloomp,  including, but not limited to an end user license agreement, shall constitute  the entire agreement between you and Bloomp concerning the Bloomp Service. If  any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of  competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the  validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall  remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of  Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any  other term, and Bloomp's failure to assert any right or provision under these  Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Bloomp  reserves the right to amend or modify these Terms of Service at any time, and  it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. If  you do not agree to the revised Terms, your only recourse is to discontinue the  use of the Bloomp Service. Your continued use of the Bloomp Service following  any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and  acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND BLOOMP AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION  ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE BLOOMP SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1)  YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS  PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Privacy Notice</strong><br />
      Bloomp Inc. (&quot;Bloomp&quot;)  recognizes that its customers, visitors and users, want to use the Bloomp  Service with privacy. Bloomp provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an  informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Bloomp Site, Bloomp  Software and/or the Bloomp Service. If you do not agree to our practices,  please do not use the Bloomp Site, Bloomp Software,or Bloomp Service.<br />
      This Privacy Policy  is incorporated into and is subject to the Bloomp Terms of Service. Your use of  the Bloomp Site, Bloomp Software and the Bloomp Service and any personal  information you provide on the Bloomp Site or Bloomp Service remains subject to  the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.<br />
      Please note that  any Status Submissions or other content posted at the direction or discretion  of users of the Bloomp Service becomes published content and is not considered  personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>What Does This  Privacy Policy Cover?</strong><br />
      This Privacy Policy  is part of Bloomp&rsquo;s Terms of Service and covers the treatment of user  information, including personally identifying information, obtained by Bloomp,  including information obtained when you access the Bloomp&rsquo;s Site, use the Bloomp  Service or any other software provided by Bloomp.<br />
      This Privacy Policy  does not apply to the practices of companies that Bloomp does not own or  control, or to individuals whom Bloomp does not employ or manage, including any  of the third parties to which Bloomp may disclose user information as set forth  in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>The Information Bloomp  Collects</strong><br />
      Bloomp may obtain  the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone  device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as  specified below (&ldquo;Personally Identifying Information&rdquo;):</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>User Provided  Information:</strong> You provide  certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number,  push notification name (if applicable), billing information (if applicable) and  mobile device information to Bloomp when choosing to participate in various  uses of the Bloomp Service, such as registering as a user, updating your status  or requesting status for your contacts. In order to provide the Bloomp Service,  Bloomp will periodically access your address book or contact list on your  mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other Bloomp users  (&ldquo;in-network&rdquo; numbers), or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as  &ldquo;out-network&rdquo; numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Cookies  Information:</strong> When you visit the  Bloomp Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a  string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies  your browser. Bloomp uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A  persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may  be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies  can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session  cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset  your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being  sent. However, the Bloomp Site may not function properly if the ability to  accept cookies is disabled.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Log File  Information:</strong> When you use the Bloomp  Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web  browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include  information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;)  address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs,  platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and  the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the  date and time of your request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify  your browser, your phone number, phone number you are requesting the status of  and various status information. When you use the Bloomp Service, our servers  log certain general information that our application sends whenever a message  is sent or received, or if you update or request any status information,  including time and date stamps and the mobile phone numbers the messages were  sent from and to.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>The Information Bloomp  Does Not Collect</strong><br />
      Bloomp does not  collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users&rsquo;  mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers—the Bloomp  mobile application will associate whatever name the Bloomp user has assigned to  the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list —  and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on Bloomp&rsquo;s  servers and is not transmitted to Bloomp. This means that if you have your  friend&rsquo;s mobile phone number associated with the name &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; in your  mobile address book, that&rsquo;s the name that will appear for that mobile phone  number in your Bloomp contact list. We do not collect location data, but users  may voluntarily share their location with other users via the Bloomp Service.<br />
      The contents of  messages that have been delivered by the Bloomp Service are not copied, kept or  archived by Bloomp in the normal course of business. The Bloomp Service uses  data service through a user&rsquo;s phone (either via cell network or wifi). Users type  their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to  the intended recipient (who must also be a Bloomp user), if that recipient is  online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in Bloomp&rsquo;s  server until it can be delivered. If the message is undelivered for thirty (30)  days, the undelivered message is deleted from our servers. Once a message has  been delivered, it no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any  delivered messages are not kept or retained by Bloomp — the only records of the  content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender&rsquo;s and  recipient&rsquo;s mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user&rsquo;s option).  Notwithstanding the above, Bloomp may retain date and time stamp information  associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers  involved in the messages, as well as any other information which Bloomp is  legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through the Bloomp Service  will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are  deleted and stripped of any identifiable information within a short period of  time in accordance with our general retention policies.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>The Way Bloomp Uses  Information</strong><br />
      If you submit  Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Bloomp Site, or Bloomp  Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and  provide to you the features and functionality of the Bloomp Site and Bloomp  Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of  the Bloomp Service and will be retained. Any billing information that may be  collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of  your account with Bloomp. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status  content that you voluntarily disclose on the Bloomp Service becomes publicly  available and may be collected and used by other users of the Bloomp Service  (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user's  mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when  you update your status messages through the Bloomp Service and other users may  contact you through the Bloomp Service. We do not use your mobile phone number  or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing  messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or  feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may,  however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without  further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying  you of major Bloomp Site or Bloomp Service changes or for customer service  purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain  non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data,  cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the  quality and design of the Bloomp Site and Bloomp Service and to create new  features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and  analyzing user preferences and trends. Hopefully we improve the Bloomp Site and  Service and don't make it suck worse. We may use cookies and log file  information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter  it during your visit or the next time you use the Bloomp Service or Bloomp  Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor  individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages  viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>When Bloomp  Discloses Information</strong><br />
      We do not sell or  share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number)  with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without  your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you  will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally  Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that  it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the Bloomp Service.  We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User  usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views,  number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in  understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements,  promotions, and/or functionality on the Bloomp Site. We may collect and release  Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable  information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such  action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S.  Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or  search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an  individual&rsquo;s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. Bloomp also reserves  the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or  non-personally-identifiable information that Bloomp believes, in good faith, is  appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions  against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party  claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect  the security or integrity of the Bloomp Site or our servers, and to protect the  rights, property, or personal safety of Bloomp, our users or others.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Your Choices</strong><br />
      You may, of course,  decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Bloomp Site  or the Bloomp Service, in which case Bloomp may not be able to provide certain  services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of  Service, please delete your account, uninstall the Bloomp mobile application  and discontinue use of the Bloomp Service; your continued usage of the Bloomp  Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and  Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable  steps (such as SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity  before registering your mobile phone number and granting you access to the Bloomp  Service. Please contact Bloomp via email to support at Bloompnote.com or  available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy,  your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Third-party  Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</strong><br />
      We are not fans of advertising. Bloomp is currently ad-free  and we hope to keep it that way forever. We have no intention to introduce advertisement  into the product, but if we ever do, will update this section.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Our Commitment To  Data Security</strong><br />
      Bloomp uses  commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to  preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot,  however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Bloomp  and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected  networks to submit messages through the Bloomp Service is never recommended.  Once we receive your transmission of information, Bloomp makes commercially  reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note  that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed,  disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical,  or managerial safeguards. If Bloomp learns of a security systems breach, then  we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate  protective steps. Bloomp may post a notice on the Bloomp Site or through the Bloomp  Service if a security breach occurs.</p>

In the (hopefully)  unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or  assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or  equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able  to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
